# BIF and BADM Variables description
The BADM (Biological Ancillary Disturbance and Metadata) in an international standard for non-continuous information that describe and complement continuous flux and meteorological (Flux/Met) data. BADM include general site description, metadata about the sensors and their setup, maintenance and disturbance events, and biological and ecological data that characterize a siteâ€™s ecosystem. The BADM Standards are co-developed and used by AmeriFlux, ICOS, European Database and other networks part of FLUXNET.

The BIF (BADM Interchange Format) is a standard ASCII Data format designed to report BADM variables in a machine readable format. It is described in the Table SM8 (Supplementary material) of Pastorello et al. 2020.
